//    Method 	                                                                Description
//    Temporal addTo(Temporal temporal) 	                                    It is used to add this duration to the specified temporal object.
//    static Duration between(Temporal startInclusive, Temporal endExclusive) 	It is used to obtain a Duration representing the duration between two temporal objects.
//    long get(TemporalUnit unit) 	                                            It is used to get the value of the requested unit.
//    boolean isNegative() 	                                                    It is used to check if this duration is negative, excluding zero.
//    boolean isZero() 	                                                        It is used to check if this duration is zero length.
//    Duration minus(Duration duration) 	                                    It is used to return a copy of this duration with the specified duration subtracted.
//    Duration plus(Duration duration) 	                                        It is used to return a copy of this duration with the specified duration added.
//    Duration abs() 	                                                        It returns a copy of this duration with a positive length.
//    static Duration between(Temporal startInclusive, Temporal endExclusive) 	It obtains a Duration representing the duration between two temporal objects.
//    int compareTo(Duration otherDuration) 	                                It compares the given duration to the specified Duration.
//    int getNano() 	                                                        It gets the number of nanoseconds within the second in this duration.
//    long getSeconds() 	                                                    It gets the number of seconds in this duration.
//    static Duration of(long amount, TemporalUnit unit) 	                    It obtains a Duration representing an amount in the specified unit.
//    static Duration ofDays(long days) 	                                    It obtains a Duration representing a number of standard 24 hour days.
//    static Duration ofHours(long hours) 	                                    It obtains a Duration representing a number of standard hours.
//    static Duration ofMillis(long millis) 	                                It obtains a Duration representing a number of milliseconds.
//    static Duration ofMinutes(long minutes) 	                                It obtains a Duration representing a number of standard minutes.
//    static Duration ofNanos(long nanos) 	                                    It obtains a Duration representing a number of nanoseconds.
//    static Duration ofSeconds(long seconds) 	                                It obtains a Duration representing a number of seconds.
